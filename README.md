# practice-computer-science
This is a personal project to do not repeat me once and once. 
I have worked in many software projects and always 
I should explain concepts about algorithm complexity, 
something that is essential when you are creating a product 
with a good performance and user experience. 
So I decided to centralize some documentation, relevant concepts, 
and some practical exercises for my team.

Any feedback is welcome!!!

## Relevant concepts

O() notation  
**In-place**: If it requires extra space (memory) to sort the elements  
**Stable**: If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called stable sorting  
**Adaptive**: A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted
